# Nimiq Accounts Manager <!-- omit in toc -->

The **Accounts Manager** (or **Nimiq Accounts**) provides a unified interface for
all Nimiq accounts, addresses, and contracts. It is the primary UI for Nimiq users
to manage their accounts and provides websites and apps with a concise API to
interact with their users' Nimiq addresses.

## The Accounts Client library

### Installation

Include the `AccountsClient` JS library as a script tag in your page:

```html
<!-- From CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nimiq/accounts-client@v0.2/dist/standalone/AccountsClient.standalone.umd.js"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nimiq/accounts-client@v0.2/dist/standalone/AccountsClient.standalone.umd.js"></script>
```

It can also be installed from NPM:

```bash
npm install @nimiq/accounts-client
# or with yarn
yarn add @nimiq/accounts-client
```

Then import or require it in your module:

```javascript
import AccountsClient from '@nimiq/accounts-client';
// or
const AccountsClient = require('@nimiq/accounts-client');
```

### Initialization

To start the client, just instantiate the class by passing it the URL of the
**Accounts Manager** to connect to:

```javascript
// Connect to testnet
const accountsClient = new AccountsClient('https://accounts.nimiq-testnet.com');

// Connect to mainnet
const accountsClient = new AccountsClient('https://accounts.nimiq.com');
```

### Usage

By default, the client opens a popup window for user interactions. On mobile
devices, a new tab will be opened instead. For simplicity, we will always refer
to popups throughout this documentation.

Popups will be blocked if not opened within the context of an active user
action. Thus, it is required that API methods are called synchronously within
the context of a user action, such as a click. See example below.

```javascript
document.getElementById('checkoutButton').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    accountsClient.checkout(/* see details below */);
});
```

For more details about avoiding popup blocking refer to
[this article](https://javascript.info/popup-windows#popup-blocking).

#### Using top-level redirects

> **Note:** To use redirects instead of popups, your app must run under a
> HTTPS domain!

If you prefer top-level redirects instead of popups, you can pass an
instance of `RedirectRequestBehavior` as a second parameter to either the
AccountsClient initialization or to any API method:

> **Note:** The way to configure top-level redirects will change in an upcoming
> version of the Accounts Client!

```javascript
const redirectBehavior = new AccountsClient.RedirectRequestBehavior();

// Pass the behavior as a second parameter to the AccountsClient
const accountsClient = new AccountsClient(<url>, redirectBehavior);

// Or pass it as a second parameter to any API method
const result = accountsClient.checkout(<requestOptions>, redirectBehavior);
```

The `RedirectRequestBehavior` accepts two optional parameters:

The first is the return URL. If no return URL is specified, the current URL
without parameters will be used.

```javascript
const redirectBehavior = new RedirectRequestBehavior('https://url.to/return?to');
```

The second optional parameter is a plain object you can use to store data until
the request returns:

```javascript
const storedData = { foo: 'I am the state' };
const redirectBehavior = new RedirectRequestBehavior(null, storedData);
```

For details on how to listen for redirect responses and retrieve the stored
data, see [Listening for redirect responses](#listening-for-redirect-responses).

### API Methods

- [Checkout](#checkout)
- [Choose Address](#choose-address)
- [Sign Transaction](#sign-transaction)
- [Signup](#signup)
- [Login](#login)
- [Onboard](#onboard)
- [Logout](#logout)
- [Export](#export)
- [Change Password](#change-password)
- [Add Address](#add-address)

> **Note:**
>
> All API methods run asynchronously and thus return promises. Please keep in
> mind that promises can also be rejected for various reasons, e.g. when the user
> cancels the request by closing the popup window or clicking on a cancel
> button.
>
> An error can also occur when the request contains invalid parameters. The request
> promise will be rejected with an `Error` object.

#### Checkout

The `checkout()` method allows your site to request a transaction from the user.
This will open a popup for the user to select the address to send from &mdash;
or cancel the request. During the payment process, the signed transaction is
sent (relayed) to the network but also returned to the caller, e.g. for
processing in your site, storage on your server or re-submittal.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Shop',

    // [optional] The path to an image on the same origin as the request is sent
    // from, must be square and will be displayed with up to 146px width and hight.
    shopLogoUrl: 'https://your.domain.com/path/to/an/image.jpg',

    // The human-readable address of the recipient (your shop/app).
    recipient: 'NQ07 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000',

    // [optional] Nimiq.Account.Type of the recipient.
    // Only required if the recipient is a vesting (1) or HTLC (2) contract.
    // Default: Nimiq.Account.Type.BASIC (0)
    //recipientType: Nimiq.Account.Type.HTLC,

    // Value of the transaction, in luna.
    value: 100 * 1e5, // 100 NIM

    // [optional] Transaction fee in luna.
    // Default: 0
    //fee: 138,

    // [optional] Extra data that should be sent with the transaction.
    // Type: string | Uint8Array | Nimiq.SerialBuffer
    // Default: new Uint8Array(0)
    //extraData: 'Hello Nimiq!',

    // [optional] Nimiq.Transaction.Flag, only required if the transaction
    // creates a contract.
    // Default: Nimiq.Transaction.Flag.NONE (0)
    //flags: Nimiq.Transaction.Flag.CONTRACT_CREATION,

    // [optional] The duration (in number of blocks) that the signed transaction
    // should be valid for. The maximum is 120.
    // Default: 120
    //validityDuration?: number;
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const signedTransaction = await accountsClient.checkout(requestOptions);
```

The `checkout()` method returns a promise which resolves to a
`SignedTransaction`:

```javascript
interface SignedTransaction {
    serializedTx: string;                  // HEX signed and serialized transaction
    hash: string;                          // HEX transaction hash

    raw: {
        signerPublicKey: Uint8Array;       // Serialized public key of the signer
        signature: Uint8Array;             // Serialized signature of the signer

        sender: string;                    // Human-readable address of sender
        senderType: Nimiq.Account.Type;    // 0, 1, 2 - see recipientType above

        recipient: string;                 // Human-readable address of recipient
        recipientType: Nimiq.Account.Type; // 0, 1, 2 - see above

        value: number;
        fee: number;
        validityStartHeight: number;       // Automatically determined validity
                                           // start height of the transaction
        extraData: Uint8Array;
        flags: number;
        networkId: number;
    }
}
```

The `serializedTx` can be handed to a Nimiq JSON-RPC's `sendRawTransaction` method.
The `raw` object can be handed to the NanoApi's `relayTransaction` method.

#### Choose Address

By using the `chooseAddress()` method, you are asking the user to select one of
their addresses to provide to your website. This can be used for example to find
out which address your app should send funds to.

**Note:** This method should not be used as a login or authentication mechanism,
as it does not provide any security that the user actually owns the provided address!

The method takes a basic request object as its only argument, which must only contain
the `appName` property:

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const address = await accountsClient.chooseAddress(requestOptions);
```

The request's result contains an address string as `address` and a `label`:

```javascript
interface Address {
    address: string;  // Human-readable address
    label: string;    // The address's label (name)
}
```

#### Sign Transaction

The `signTransaction()` method is similar to checkout, but provides a different
UI to the user. The main difference to `checkout()` is that it requires the
request to already include the sender's address as `sender`, as well as the
transaction's `validityStartHeight`. The created transaction will only be
returned to the caller, not sent to the network automatically.

For brevity, most duplicate parameter explanations are omitted here, please
refer to [Checkout](#checkout) for more details.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // Sender information
    sender: 'NQxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx',

    recipient: 'NQxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx',
    value: 100 * 1e5, // 100 NIM

    // Optional attributes, see checkout method for details
    //senderType: Nimiq.Account.Type.BASIC,
    //recipientType: Nimiq.Account.Type.BASIC,
    //fee: 0,
    //extraData: new Uint8Array(0),
    //flags: Nimiq.Transaction.Flag.NONE,

    // The transaction's validity start height.
    // A transaction is only valid for 120 blocks after its validityStartHeight.
    // Transactions with a validityStartHeight higher than <current network
    // block height + 1> are rejected and need to be sent again later during
    // their validity window.
    validityStartHeight: 123456,
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const signedTransaction = await accountsClient.signTransaction(requestOptions);
```

The `signTransaction()` method returns a `SignedTransaction`. See
[Checkout](#checkout) for details.

#### Signup

The `signup()` method creates a new account in the **Accounts Manager**. The user
will choose an Identicon and optionally set a password.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const account = await accountsClient.signup(requestOptions);
```

The `signup()` method returns a promise which resolves to an `Account`:

```javascript
interface Account {
    accountId: string;      // Automatically generated account ID
    label: string;          // The label (name) generated for the account

    type: WalletType;       // 1 for in-browser multi-address accounts,
                            // 2 for Ledger hardware accounts

    fileExported: boolean;  // These two flags signal if the user already
    wordsExported: boolean; // has the Login File or the recovery words

    addresses: Array<{      // During signup, only one address is added to the account
        address: string;    // Human-readable address
        label: string;      // The label (name) of the address
    }>;
}
```

#### Login

The `login()` method allows the user to add an existing account to the
**Accounts Manager** by importing their *Login File*, *Recovery Words* or
old *Account Access File*. After an account has been imported, the
**Accounts Manager** automatically detects active addresses following the
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#account-discovery)
method.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const account = await accountsClient.login(requestOptions);
```

The `login()` method returns a promise which resolves to an `Account`. Please see
the result type for [`signup()`](#signup) for details.

#### Onboard

The `onboard()` method presents a choice menu between _Signup_, _Login_, and
_Connect Ledger_ to the user and is thus a general purpose onboarding method.
Just like the direct methods, it only requires a simple request object:

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const account = await accountsClient.onboard(requestOptions);
```

Since `onboard()` is a wrapper around Signup, Login and Ledger, it also returns an
`Account` result type. Please see the result type for [`signup()`](#signup) for details.

#### Logout

The `logout()` method removes an account from the **Accounts Manager**. During the
logout process, the user can export the *Login File* or *Recovery Words* before
the account is deleted.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The ID of the account that should be removed
    accountId: 'xxxxxxxx',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const logoutResult = await accountsClient.logout(requestOptions);
```

The `logout()` method returns a promise which resolves to a simple object
containing the `success` property, which is always true:

```javascript
{ success: true }
```

#### Export

Using the `export()` method, a user can retrieve the *Login File* or
*Recovery Words* of an account.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The ID of the account to export
    accountId: 'xxxxxxxx',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const exportResult = await accountsClient.export(requestOptions);
```

The `export()` method returns a promise which resolves to an object that
contains flags for each export type:

```javascript
interface ExportResult {
    fileExported: boolean;
    wordsExported: boolean;
}
```

#### Change Password

With the `changePassword()` method, a user can change the password of an account:

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The ID of the account whose password should be changed
    accountId: 'xxxxxxxx',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const result = await accountsClient.changePassword(requestOptions);
```

The `changePassword()` method returns a promise which resolves to a simple object
containing the `success` property, which is always true:

```javascript
{ success: true }
```

#### Add Address

By using the `addAddress()` method, the user is able to derive and add an additional
address to their account. The method returns the added address and its label.

The method takes a simple request object as its argument:

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The ID of the account to which an address should be added
    accountId: 'xxxxxxxx',
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const address = await accountsClient.addAddress(requestOptions);
```

The request's result contains an address string as `address` and a `label`:

```javascript
interface Address {
    address: string;  // Human-readable address
    label: string;    // The address's label (name)
}
```

#### Rename

To rename a user's account or addresses, you can call the `rename()` method. The
UI for the rename action always presents the given account and all its addresses
to the user. By sending an optional address with the request, that address's label
will be already pre-selected for the user.

This method takes the following request object as its only argument:

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The ID of the account which should be renamed, or to which the
    // address, which should be renamed, belongs
    accountId: 'xxxxxxxx',

    // [optional] The human-readable address which should be pre-selected
    // for the user to be renamed
    address: 'NQxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx';
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const account = await accountsClient.rename(requestOptions);
```

Since more than one label can be renamed during the rename request, the result
contains the whole account, including all visible addresses. Please see the
result type for [`signup()`](#signup) for details about the `Account` object.

#### Sign Message

To let the user sign an arbitrary message with any of their addresses, you can
call `signMessage()` with the following request object. If you do not include
a `signer` property, the user will be prompted to select an address from their
available accounts. The message can be either a string or a Uint8Array byte array.

```javascript
const requestOptions = {
    // The name of your app, should be as short as possible.
    appName: 'Nimiq Safe',

    // The message to sign. Can either be string of valid UTF-8 or a
    // byte array to sign arbitrary data
    message: 'String to sign' || new Uint8Array([...]),

    // [optional] The human-readable address with which to sign
    signer: 'NQxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx';
};

// All client requests are async and return a promise
const signedMessage = await accountsClient.signMessage(requestOptions);
```

The method returns a `SignedMessage` object containing the following properties:

```javascript
interface SignedMessage {
    signer: string;               // Userfriendly address
    signerPublicKey: Uint8Array;  // The public key of the signer
    signature: Uint8Array;        // Signature for the message
    message: string | Uint8Array; // The signed message (as the same type as it
                                  // was handed in)
}
```

**Note:** To prevent users from signing valid transactions or other
blockchain-related proofs which could be used to impersonate them, the Nimiq
Keyguard prefixes the string `'Nimiq Signed Message: '` (22 one-byte-characters)
to the input message. The signature is then created over the combined message.
The prefix is already included in the result's `message` property.

Verifying a signed message could go like this:

```javascript
const signature = new Nimiq.Signature(signedMessage.signature);
const publicKey = new Nimiq.PublicKey(signedMessage.signerPublicKey);

const message = typeof signedMessage.message === 'string'
    ? Nimiq.BufferUtils.fromUtf8(signedMessage.message))
    : signedMessage.message;

// Check signature against the message
const isValid = signature.verify(publicKey, message);
```

### Listening for redirect responses

If you configured the AccountsClient to use
[top-level redirects](#using-top-level-redirects) instead of popups, you need to
follow the four steps below to specifically listen for the redirects from the
**Accounts Manager** back to your site, using the `on()` method.

Your handler functions will be called with two parameters: the result object and
the stored data object as it was passed to the
`RedirectRequestBehavior` [during initialization](#using-top-level-redirects).

```javascript
// 1. Initialize an Accounts Manager client instance
const accountsClient = new AccountsClient(/* ... */);

// 2. Define your handler functions
const onSuccess = function(result, storedData) {
    console.log("Got result from Accounts Manager:", result);
    console.log("Retrieved stored data:": storedData);
}

const onError = function(error, storedData) {
    console.log("Got error from Accounts Manager:", error);
    console.log("Retrieved stored data:": storedData);
}

// 3. Listen for the redirect responses you expect
accountsClient.on(AccountsClient.RequestType.CHECKOUT, onSuccess, onError);
accountsClient.on(AccountsClient.RequestType.SIGN_TRANSACTION, onSuccess, onError);
accountsClient.on(AccountsClient.RequestType.LOGIN, onSuccess, onError);

// 4. After setup is complete, check for a redirect response
accountsClient.checkRedirectResponse();
```

<!-- QUESTION/IDEA The RPC ID should be explained.
     Can the dev retrieve the ID before triggering the API method so that later
     on request and result can be aligned?
     If not, what's the potential use of the ID?
     I suggestion to remove it, or at least make the ID third and thus optional.
     -->
The available `RequestType`s, corresponding to the API methods, are:

```javascript
enum AccountsClient.RequestType {
    CHECKOUT = 'checkout',
    CHOOSE_ADDRESS = 'choose-address',
    SIGN_TRANSACTION = 'sign-transaction',
    SIGNUP = 'signup',
    LOGIN = 'login',
    ONBOARD = 'onboard',
    LOGOUT = 'logout',
    EXPORT = 'export',
    CHANGE_PASSWORD = 'change-password',
    ADD_ADDRESS = 'add-address',
    RENAME = 'rename',
    SIGN_MESSAGE = 'sign-message',
}
```

## Running your own Accounts Manager

TODO

If you want to run your own instance of Accounts Manager, you also need to run
an instance of the [Keyguard](https://github.com/nimiq/keyguard-next/).

## Contribute

To get started with working on the source code, pull the code and install the dependencies:

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nimiq/accounts.git
cd accounts
yarn
```

### Run

Compile and serve with hot-reload in the background for development:

```bash
yarn run serve
```

Compile and lint continuously in the background for development:

```bash
yarn run build --watch
```

Lint and fix files:

```bash
yarn run lint
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
yarn run test
```

### Build

Compile and minify for production:

```bash
yarn run build
```

### Configuration

The following values can be changed via configuration files:

- keyguardEndpoint: The location of your keyguard instance.
- network: The network you want to use. Possible values are 'main', 'test' and
  'dev'. You can use the constants (see default configs).
- networkEndpoint: The location of the network iframe instance you want to use.
- privilegedOrigins: An array of origins with special access rights, nameley
  permission to use iframe methods like `list()`.

The default config file is `config.local.ts`. To use a different file
(especially useful for deployment), set an environment variable
`build`. E.g. `export build='testnet'` to use `config.testnet.ts`. To set
environment variables permanently, please refer to your server's documentation,
e.g. [for Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/env.html).
